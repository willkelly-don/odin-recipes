    <h1> Ingredients</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>400g beef mince</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>100g carrot, grated</li>
        <li>2x 400g tins of chopped tomato</li>
        <li>400ml stock (ideally beef)</li>
        <li>400g dried spaghetti</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large saucepan over a medium heat. Add a tablespoon of olive oil and 
            once hot add the beef mince and a pinch of salt and pepper. 
            Cook the mince until well browned over a medium-high heat (be 
            careful not to burn the mince. It just needs to be a dark brown colour). 
            Once browned, transfer the mince to a bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>
            Add another tablespoon of oil to the saucepan you browned the mince in and 
            turn the heat to medium. Add the onions and a pinch of salt and fry gently 
            for 5-6 minutes, or until softened and translucent. Add the garlic and cook for
             another 2 minutes. Add the grated carrot then pour the mince and any juices in 
             the bowl back into the saucepan.</li>
        <li>
            Add the tomatoes to the pan and stir well to mix. Pour in the stock, bring to a 
            simmer and then reduce the temperature to simmer gently for 45 minutes, or until 
            the sauce is thick and rich. Taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary.</li>
        <li>
            When ready to cook the spaghetti, heat a large saucepan of water and add a pinch 
            of salt. Cook according to the packet instructions. Once the spaghetti is cooked 
            through, drain and add to the pan with the bolognese sauce. Mix well and serve.</li>
