    <h1> Ingredients</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>100g pancetta</li>
        <li>50g pecorino cheese</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>350g spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>50g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Put a large saucepan of water on to boil</li>
        <li>Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. 
            Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.</li>
        <li>Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little 
            freshly grated black pepper. Set everything aside.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water 
            comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes 
            or until al dente (just cooked).</li>
        <li> Squash 2 peeled plum garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it</li>
        <li>Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to 
            the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente 
            (just cooked).</li>
        <li>Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the 
            pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted its flavour, 
            so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.</li>
        <li>Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water 
            with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away yet.</li>
        <li>Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.</li>
        <li>Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated. </li>
        <li>Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). You don’t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed. </li>
        <li>Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper. If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived. </li>
